# Foundation Models Framework Example

This code is a fork from [Rudrank Riyam's **Foundation Models Framework Example**](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/Foundation-Models-Framework-Example). I used it as a platform to add some Image Analysis experiments.


## Requirements

- iOS 26.0+ or macOS 26.0+ (Xcode 26.0+)
- **Xcode 26 official is required**
- Apple Intelligence enabled
- Compatible Apple device with Apple Silicon

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Open `FoundationLab.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Ensure you have a device with Apple Intelligence enabled
- Build and run the project
- (Optional) For web search functionality:
  - Get an API key from [Exa AI](https://exa.ai)
  - Tap the gear icon in the app to access Settings
  - Enter your Exa API key in the settings screen
- Explore the different capabilities through the examples!

## What's Inside

The app has four main sections provided by the project from which I forked:

* Examples
* Integration
* Chat
* Voice.
* 
My **Image Analysis** was added in the Examples Section at the very top.
